Long long ago, there was a princess lived in a forest.She is very beautiful, and had a lot of dogs.
One day, this princess was taking her dogs out on a walk, when the met a troll! Fortunately, this was a nice troll, and he had them all over for tea and biscuits.

The troll had many amazing pets like cats, lizards, dogs, and a few others you couldn't even name. They were all very friendly and let you pet them and feed them.
