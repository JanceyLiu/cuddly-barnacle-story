Long long ago, there was a princess lived in a forest.She is very beautiful, and had a lot of dogs.
One day, this princess was taking her dogs out on a walk, when the met a troll! Fortunately, this was a nice troll, and he had them all over for tea and biscuits.

The troll had many amazing pets like cats, lizards, dogs, and a few others you couldn't even name. They were all very friendly and let you pet them and feed them.

Finally, the princess and troll became friend, and their pet became friends too.
